                        During this internship, I mainly worked together with two other team members and later on, another two, to create a Python app that would help with diagnosing patients with Chronic Lower Back Pain.
                        This app mainly utilized OpenCV and Mediapipe to take in video feed, for example, from the users' webcam or from a recorded video, and would track 33 key landmarks of the individual being recorded, alongside 
                        another 4 additional landmarks which we were predicting using singular value thresholding algorithms. In addition to tracking the landmarks, we would also track the users face to predict the 
                        emotion they were displaying which we would later use in a neural network to predict what emotion the individual would experience when doing certain motions and exercises.

                        The project consisted of two main parts, one being a general financial QnA bot to answer basic questions from users 
                        and the other being a more personalized investment planner to give users recommendations based on information they provide.

                    Trying to manage my budget while living away from my parents and trying to take care of myself was something I wanted to get better at, with trying to 
                    see in what ways I could try to decrease my spendings. At the same time, instead of simply grabbing one of the web, I decided it could serve as another good 
                    learning experience and as such, I wanted to try making my own while working with something new. That something new ended up being ReactJS and so I tried 
                    testing out a lot of different features of it. While I was initially planning on making it fairly simple, with simply adding and deleting budgets or expenses,
                    I thought it would be nice to include some other features, such as summaries for a month and stuff like repeat expenses with how many subscription services 
                    are popping up now. As a result, I tried working with a low of different aspects of ReactJS, such as contexts, hooks, and components, and to also make the website 
                    as responsive as I can, so that you can easily see any changes and updates.

                    with them in the past and so I wanted to try utilizing a bunch of APIs to achieve my goal. In the end, I finished with a different product than 
                    what I was initially planned but was still fairly happy with the product, creating a website that allows the user to make queries, using either 
                    keywords or by providing a link to an image. I had planned on only trying to use particular artist platforms to webscrape through but ended up simply 
                    using an API to go through Google. I was trying to make a sort of reverse image search feature and to provide details such as the images' 
                    dimensions, original creator, and more.

                    With one of my favorite video-game genres being roguelikes, one of my biggest interests was trying to develop such a game myself.
                    The game involves a lot of different mechanics such as the randomizing of 10 different stages alongside enemies and items to allow 
                    for a unique play-through every single time. The enemies themselves have different stats such as there being faster, but weaker enemies 
                    whereas others are much slower but hit much harder. In addition, every 5 stages features 1 of 2 bosses, each with unique abilities and 
                    a real-time updating health bar and will also drop a powerful item upon defeat. The player has many different stats such as movement speed,
                    physical and magic damage, and defense, all of which can be increased using the various items scattered around the stages.

                    Gaming has always been one of my biggest hobbies and passions for as long as I can remember and is one of the main reasons as to how I got interested in wanting to persue software.
                    Growing up, Minecraft was undoubtedly my favorite game and my biggest entry into thinking about how circuits and programming worked in a way. I used to do a lot of redstone contraptions 
                    and random command block ideas alongside playing with a bunch of mods and this got me interested in learning more about circuits and how mods were made. I always found it really funny whenever 
                    we would get introduced to certain topics in classes and I would realize that I've heard a lot of these terms like gates and latches before in redstone tutorials. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My favorite genres are Role-Playing Games and Roguelikes of which, one large aspect of these sorts of games is generally learning about enemies and their various AI/patterns which 
                    has always been one of my favorite parts about these types of games and what sparked my interest in AI. Overall, this hobby in gaming is what inspired my interest in AI, machine learning, and 
                    programming in general and as a result, the main reason why I wanted to pursue the computer engineering program at the University of Waterloo as I thought it would be a good opportunity to 
                    gain experience in such things both in class and through coops.

                    A massive part of this website is also heavily inspired by one of my favorite games, Nier Automata. Nier Automata's UI has always stood out to me as one of the most interesting and unique designs 
                    I've seen in gaming and as such, I wanted to try my best to recreate most of it. While the welcome menu is mostly original, the main menu is based on the in-game menu where I tried to recreate most 
                    features, including minor details that in general, I haven't seen being replicated often in other recreations of the game's UI such as the little sideways arrow over the sidebar when you hover over a tab. 
                    However, there are also a fair number of details that I did not implement/keep such as the border on the top and bottom and keeping the grid present when you open one of the tabs. 
                    I also wanted to try keeping everything on one screen size and webpage to eliminate the need for scrolling and for a smoother experience.

                    Gaming has also been a big influence on the sort of music I listen to, with a large number of music I listen to being soundtracks from games like Nier, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Devil May Cry.

                    Just like with gaming, anime and manga has been one of my main hobbies and interests in the past few years and has also helped influence other hobbies of mine like music. Just like in gaming, a lot of 
                    music I listen to come from anime soundtracks such as from Made in Abyss and The Ancient Magus' Bride. Anime has always been a big part of my life growing up with shows like Naruto and Dragon Ball but 
                    I started watching much less after starting high school. However, anime and manga still remains as one of my favourite hobbies and I still find it as something I can easily enjoy and talk about with friends. 
                    Anime was also one of the big motivating factors in keeping me interested in music with learning various songs on piano alongside simply watching plenty of anime about music like Your Lie in April.

                    have thought about getting back into it but have not had much of a chance. Piano was a really fun way for me to connect to some of my other hobbies as there were a lot of times when I haved tried learning various songs 
                    from games and anime. Recently, I've been getting very into trance music through the game Punishing Gray Raven and a lot of cultural music through Genshin Impact.
